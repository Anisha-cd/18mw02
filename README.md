Bee hive is the place of closure where honey bee lives it serves many purposes such storing of honey,
pollination of crops which is the major for food production. It is essential to predict the health of the
bee hive using machine learning techniques as it has a major impact on food production. The bee
hive health can be predicted by classifying the bee as healthy and unhealthy( infected by varroa mites )
which will be useful for monitoring better bee hive health. The proposed system uses ensemble hard
voting classifier for bee hive health prediction as it aggregates the predictions of various classifiers.
The various classifiers used in ensemble hard voting algorithm are decision tree, logistic regression, k
nearest neighbors, polynomial support vector machine(SVM), SVM-RBF, SVM- sigmoid.
The prediction is based on two features location and subspecies present in the dataset retrieved from
kaggle repository. The class label “health” has six categories, the classifier classifies the bee hive data
into the six health categories. The proposed system can be used in bee hive health monitoring system.
